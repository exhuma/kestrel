# Specification Quality Checklist: A readable cockpit

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- This project's specs name domain concepts from the board model: card
  kinds, trust, `.kestrel/screenshots/`, `verification_gap`. They are the
  operator's own vocabulary, not implementation choices. The spec names no
  framework or library.
- Clarifications were settled with the operator before specifying: screenshots
  are captured during the work and embedded in the PR body, and the work runs
  as one speckit feature.
