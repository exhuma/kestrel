# Architecture

_System context as of 2026-07-05 (alpha). For the detailed design notes see
`docs/superpowers/specs/`._

Kestrel is a **single-user** tool that dispatches and monitors coding-agent
sessions from a web UI. One process serves both the API and (when packaged)
the built SPA.

## Components

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| **FastAPI backend** (`backend/app`) | HTTP API, session/workflow orchestration, SSE streaming |
| **Backend adapters** (`backend/app/backends`) | Dispatch targets behind one `Backend` protocol: `claude_cli`, `opencode`, `openai_compat` |
| **Persistence** (`backend/app/persistence`) | SQLite via SQLAlchemy, schema managed by Alembic |
| **SPA** (`frontend/`) | Vue 3 + Vuetify UI; in the image it is served same-origin by the backend |

## Key boundaries

- **The `Backend` protocol** (`backends/base.py`) is the seam everything above
  the adapters talks to. It exposes `start` / `resume` / `run_turn` /
  `terminate` and a `Capability` set (`TEXT`, `FILE_EDITS`, `TOOL_USE`). A
  step is served only by a backend whose capabilities are a superset of the
  step's requirement, so a plain LLM can serve a text step but not an
  `implement` step. Adapters never leak a tool's flags or output format
  upward.
- **A canonical event vocabulary** (`models.py`) normalizes each backend's
  native stream (claude's `stream-json`, opencode's SSE, an LLM's tokens)
  onto one timeline the UI consumes.
- **Server-sent events** carry that timeline to the browser live; the backend
  adds heartbeat/anti-buffering headers so the UI updates in real time.
- **Per-run git workspaces** under `KESTREL_WORKSPACE_ROOT` isolate each
  session's file edits and stay browsable on the host.

## External dependencies

The image bundles only the `claude` CLI (plus Node and git). `opencode` and
self-hosted LLMs are **external backing services addressed by URL** — started
separately and reached over HTTP, never bundled into the image. This keeps
the image small and lets a deploy attach or swap backends purely by config.

## Data & auth

- **State** lives in SQLite on the `/data` volume; migrations run on every
  container start (idempotent).
- **Agent auth** is inherited from the host `claude` login (seeded read-only
  into the container), never re-implemented by kestrel. The only secret
  kestrel itself consumes is an optional `KESTREL_GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- **Untrusted input.** Kestrel runs an agent over untrusted GitHub-issue text,
  so prompt injection is a first-class threat. The threat model, the controls
  that mitigate it, and the operator responsibilities that back them are in
  [`security.md`](./security.md). Read it before deploying.

## Design trade-offs

- **Single shared-secret auth, single user.** `KESTREL_API_TOKEN` gates the
  `/api` surface; when unset the server binds loopback only. This is not
  multi-user authn (out of scope for the alpha) — see
  [`security.md`](./security.md).
- **CLI subprocess for claude, HTTP for the rest.** Reuses the user's
  existing Claude login and MCP/plugin config without an SDK or API key, at
  the cost of depending on the CLI's stream format (isolated in one adapter).
- **SQLite.** Right-sized for a single user; the `KESTREL_DATABASE_URL` seam
  leaves room to attach another database later.
